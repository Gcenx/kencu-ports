# kencu-ports

This repo contains my personal fork of macports-ports tree, with my own modifications to suit my purposes.

You would be wise not to use this.

The general principle here is a grand simplification of the ports tree, removal of most portgroups, removal of extraneous code, and similar modifications to bring the ports tree under control.

If there are two ways to do things, this repo will choose the simpler way.
