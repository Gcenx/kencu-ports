# kencu-ports

This repo contains my personal fork of macports-ports tree, with my own modifications to suit my purposes.

You would be wise not to use this.

The general principle here is a grand simplification of the ports tree, removal of most portgroups, removal extraneous code, and similar.

If there are two ways to do things, this repo will choose the simpler way.
